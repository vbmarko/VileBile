- Hi, I’m @VileBile
- I’m interested in: 
     - Computational Neuroscience, mostly computational properties of single neurons and small scale networks.
      
     - Developmental Psychology and Neuroscience from a constructivist and dynamical systems perspective.
     
     - Machine learning mostly for modeling animal learning and development, though modern ML methods are fascinating in their own right.
     
     - Theories of human drive and motivation, currently I am fascinated by Jaques Lacans attempt to formalise Freudian theory.
     
     - I find mathematical modeling in general a fun and verry reassuring approach to understanding systems.

- I’m currently learning ...
      
     - Computational Neuroscience using:
          - Abbot & Dayan, Theoretical Neuroscince. https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/theoretical-neuroscience
          - Izhikevich, Dynamical Systems in Neuroscience. https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/dynamical-systems-neuroscience 
          - Koch, Biophysics of Computation. https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780195104912.001.0001/isbn-9780195104912
          - Michael Fees Introduction to Neural Computation course. https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/brain-and-cognitive-sciences/9-40-introduction-to-neural-computation-spring-2018/
      
     - Ordinary Differential equations using:
          - Miller and Mattucks course. https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-03-differential-equations-spring-2010/index.htm
               and the associated book: Elementary Differential Eqs. with Boundary Value Problems: https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/product/Edwards-Elementary-Differential-Equations-with-Boundary-Value-Problems-6th-Edition/9780136006138.html

- I write in:
    - Python is where I first learned to program and I still love it for putting together quick projects.
    
    - Julia I learned after becoming annoyed by Python for not having linear algebra in base and have since fallen in love with the syntax as well as the community around it.
    
    - Matlab I find to be usefull for setting up models of physical systems.
    
- I keep a personal blog at: https://medium.com/@markovinkl where I write about anything and everything that happens to peak my interest


- I’m looking to collaborate on cool projects
